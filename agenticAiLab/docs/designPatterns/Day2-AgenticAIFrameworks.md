Abundance of Frameworks: Numerous frameworks exist as abstraction layers that aim to simplify the development of agentic solutions. It's crucial to understand this landscape since new frameworks frequently emerge.

# Simplicity vs. Complexity: The frameworks are categorized based on complexity:

- ## No Framework Approach:

  Directly connecting to LLMs via APIs offers complete control over prompts and interactions, which can lead to successful outcomes according to a blog post by Anthropic.
  Model Context Protocol (MCP):
  An open-source protocol by Anthropic that allows seamless connections between models and data sources without extensive glue code, which makes it a lightweight option.

- ## Lightweight Frameworks:

  OpenAI Agents SDK: Known for its simplicity and flexibility.
  Crew: A low-code framework that allows configuration of agents primarily through YAML files, making it user-friendly.

- ## Heavyweight Frameworks:
  Langraph and Autogen: These frameworks are more complex and come with a steeper learning curve but allow for sophisticated computational graphs. They require a deeper understanding of their ecosystems and terminology.
